Belonging to <a href="http://sap.ist.i.kyoto-u.ac.jp/EN/">Kawahara lab.</a>, my current main research topic is low-resource Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) using the technologies of deep neural networks. Other my properties are described in my <a href="/CV/">CV</a>.

### Why I work on the deep learning field

Since my early childhood, I occasionally have thought about "what are we?", "what is thinking?", "what makes us humans", and, well, such things.   
I had no concrete materials of these thoughts for first two decades of my life, but now I have. I believe that deep learning is one of the most reasonable ways of investigating ourselves.  
Hence, I am interested in all about deep learning, and really happy to be involved with it!
